    <h3 class="text-center blue-color">Project -Psiho Nest </h3>
    <a href="https://psihonest.ro/" target="_blank">Mihaela's web site;</a>
    <p>The project started from my passion and hobby for Psychology and IT Recruitment.
        The website had to contain 2 areas, HR and Psychology, both presenting customized services and solutions
        for each of them.
        One important request was that the website had to load very fast and have a high SEO score, so the
        serverside
        rendering (SSR) from Angular provided the best solution in this case. I was responsible for maintenance
        of the web side or any necessary continuous add (ie.: articles). I participated on an actively hands-on
        manner,
        on the developing side, being motivated to learn and develop my technical skills beside my mentors.</p>
